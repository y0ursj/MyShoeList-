Some of its new features include a reflective tongue (with a unique protruding design and look), translucent rubber soles and lace locks.[6] The soles gave them a new look, but yellowed over time when exposed to moisture and were the source of many complaints early on due to the slippery nature of the soles when collecting dust.Hatfield is believed to have drawn inspiration for the Air Jordan V from World War II fighter planes, which was most notably visible in the shark teeth shapes on the midsole.",
